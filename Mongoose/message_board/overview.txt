So the point here is setting up a more complicated series of models in Express, with validations and relationships between them.
The template will also have to be a little more complicated based on what comes back in the JSON result of the query. So we'll have to make that work out once we see what comes back from a joined query.
What do the models need to look like? No user model--user name will be in the message and the comment models separately. Instead we're looking at one for the messages, one for the comments. The two will be tied together.

So we'll need a rotue for displaying all messages with their associated comments, one for adding a message, one for adding a comment. The forms for the latter two will just be part of the main page.

The form for adding a comment to a message must have the url for that specific message included in its action attribute.
